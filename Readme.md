# AutoML for Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction
This project focuses on creating a proof of concept for an AutoML pipeline that can be used to predict the compressive strength of concrete. The dataset used for this project is the [Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 1030 instances and 9 attributes. The goal of this project is to predict the compressive strength of concrete using the given attributes.

This is an initial effort to potentially expand the scope of AutoML to civil engineering applications. 

This project is a work in progress and was initially undertaken as part of the course Applications of AI in Civil Engineering at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, Pilani Campus. The project is being developed by [Abhigyan Shanker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhigyan-shanker-1b26501b2/).
